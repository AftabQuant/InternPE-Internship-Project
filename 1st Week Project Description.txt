🚀 Excited to Share My 1st Week Project! 🎉

        As part of my Java Programming Internship with InternPE, I’ve developed a fun and interactive Guesser Game. This console-based game involves players guessing a number generated by the computer, with a variety of outcomes based on their guesses.

🔍 Key Features:

  i) Random Number Generation: Utilizes Java's Random class to generate a number for players to guess.
  ii) Multiple Players: Supports up to three players with individual guesses.
  iii) Dynamic Feedback: Provides feedback on whether players won or lost and hints if the guess is too high or too low.

This project has been a fantastic opportunity to hone my Java skills and apply concepts learned in my coursework.

Feel free to check out the code and share your thoughts! GitHub https://github.com/AftabQuant/InternPE-Internship-Project.git
