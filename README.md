 Objective: The goal of the Guesser Game is to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. Players take turns to make guesses, and the game provides feedback based on their guesses.
     Key Features:
           i) At the start of the game, a random number is generated within a predefined range. This number is kept secret from the players.

           ii) The game supports multiple players, allowing each player to take turns guessing the number.

           iii) Players enter their guesses one at a time. The game checks each guess against the randomly generated number.

           iv) After each guess, the game provides feedback to the player:

              Too High: If the guess is higher than the target number.
              Too Low: If the guess is lower than the target number.
              Correct: If the guess matches the target number.
          v) Game End Conditions: The game ends when a player correctly guesses the number. The player who guesses the number correctly is declared the winner.
